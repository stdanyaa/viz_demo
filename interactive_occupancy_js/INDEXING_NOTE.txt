CORRECT INDEXING FOR OCCUPANCY DATA
================================================================================

The occupancy data uses a specific indexing scheme that must be preserved:

Shape: [nx, ny, nz] = [400, 400, 32]

Index formula: z + y*nz + x*nz*ny

This means:
- z varies fastest (changes every element)
- y varies second (changes every nz elements)  
- x varies slowest (changes every nz*ny elements)

This is DIFFERENT from standard C-order which would be: x + y*nx + z*nx*ny

DO NOT CHANGE THIS INDEXING - it is correct for this data format.
